# 怎麼使用 AI4Finance-Foundation / FinRobot ？把它包裝成自己的應用

In recent years, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the financial sector has revolutionized how financial analysis and decision-making processes are conducted. One of the most promising developments in this domain is the introduction of [FinRobot](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRobot), an open-source AI agent platform developed by the [AI4Finance Foundation](https://ai4finance.org/). This platform leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address complex financial challenges by breaking them down into logical sequences, thereby democratizing access to advanced AI techniques for both professional analysts and laypersons.

FinRobot is structured into four major layers, each designed to enhance the platform's functionality and accessibility. The first layer, the Financial AI Agents layer, formulates a Financial Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling users to tackle sophisticated financial problems systematically. The second layer, the Financial LLM Algorithms layer, dynamically configures model application strategies tailored to specific tasks, ensuring adaptability and precision.

The third layer, LLMOps and DataOps, focuses on producing accurate models through training and fine-tuning techniques, utilizing task-relevant data to optimize performance. Finally, the Multi-source LLM Foundation Models layer integrates various LLMs, providing seamless access to these models for the preceding layers.

By open-sourcing FinRobot, the AI4Finance Foundation aims to bridge the gap between the finance sector and the AI community, overcoming barriers such as proprietary data and specialized knowledge. This initiative not only promotes wider AI adoption in financial decision-making but also supports a collaborative network of academic scholars, financial professionals, and companies. The foundation's commitment to open-source development is further exemplified by its other projects, such as [FinGPT](https://ai4finance.org/), which focuses on financial Large Language Models, and [FinRL](https://ai4finance.org/), which explores financial reinforcement learning.

As financial institutions and professionals increasingly incorporate LLMs into their workflows, platforms like FinRobot offer a robust framework for developing customized applications. By packaging FinRobot into bespoke solutions, users can enhance their operational efficiency and analytical capabilities, paving the way for innovative financial applications.
