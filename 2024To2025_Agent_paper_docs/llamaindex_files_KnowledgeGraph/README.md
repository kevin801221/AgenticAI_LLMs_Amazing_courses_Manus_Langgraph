Knowledge graphs play a pivotal role in AI-driven applications, particularly in large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots. These graphs organize vast datasets, making information retrieval faster and more precise, which is essential for creating effective, context-aware responses.

Data frameworks like [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) bridge the gap between LLMs and various data structures that store the relevant information, making it easier to build applications that use AI features, for example with the help of [CreateLlama](https://github.com/run-llama/create-llama).

To provide the necessary context to the LLM, the AI integration uses a Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. However, managing and interacting with knowledge graphs pose significant challenges for developers. These graphs often involve complex relationships and intricate structures, making debugging and optimization difficult without clear visualization tools.

The challenge of working with knowledge graphs
----------------------------------------------

Developers building AI agents often struggle with knowledge graphs due to the complexity of data relationships, the challenge of debugging response paths for accuracy, and the need to optimize data flow for performance. Without effective visualization tools, these obstacles can lead to inefficiencies, making it harder to interpret, debug, and refine AI-driven insights.

### Graph visualization matters for AI developers

AI developers need tools that simplify the interaction with complex data structures. A robust visualization framework makes it easier to debug and optimize the performance of the graph, ensuring that the chatbot or AI application works effectively.

Graphs allow developers to explore the reasoning behind responses, validate the accuracy and relevance of data, and streamline the entire development process. By providing clear visual insights, graphs help accelerate the creation of more reliable and efficient AI systems.

### Data-driven visualization and interactivity are key

Integrating visual graph outputs into LLM frameworks like LlamaIndex provides significant benefits. Developers gain clarity in data relationships by visually mapping nodes and edges, making the flow of information more intuitive. Debugging becomes simpler as active nodes and pathways are highlighted, allowing errors to be quickly identified. Optimization improves as inefficiencies can be spotted and refined in real time.

Moreover, interactive visualizations offer significant advantages over static images, especially when dealing with large and evolving graph structures. They enable developers to seamlessly navigate complex data, zoom in on key areas, and reveal additional details as needed by interacting with the graph. Real-time updates further enhance this experience by reflecting changes instantly, allowing developers to monitor data flow dynamically, identify bottlenecks as they occur, and fine-tune their AI systems with immediate feedback.

### Challenges in visualizing complex and dynamic graphs

Visualizing large and complex knowledge graphs presents significant challenges, including navigating massive data sets, identifying meaningful clusters, and managing dynamic interactions. Developers often struggle with rendering large graphs, which can appear cluttered and confusing, making it difficult to identify key relationships or areas of interest.

Integration in CreateLlama step by step instructions
----------------------------------------------------

The [yfiles-graph-for-create-llama](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-graph-for-create-llama) project illustrates, how yFiles can be integrated in a [CreateLlama](https://github.com/run-llama/create-llama) created project.

The project consists of two main components: the chatbot frontend with a graph visualization component and the Python backend that resolves user queries.

*   Backend: Powered by Python, the backend accesses the knowledge graph stored in LlamaIndex to generate responses. When a user asks a question, the backend queries the graph, retrieves relevant nodes, and returns them to the frontend for visualization.
*   Frontend: Built with React, the frontend visualizes interactions between the user and the knowledge graph. As the chatbot generates responses, yFiles dynamically updates the graph, highlighting relevant nodes and expanding them to provide additional context. This real-time interaction ensures a smooth experience for both developers and end users.

The basic steps on how to integrate yFiles in this project are outlined here:

1.  Create a new project with CreateLlama.
    
    Use the [CreateLlama CLI](https://github.com/run-llama/create-llama) to create a new project with the options specified in its tutorial
    
    *   npx create-llama@latest
    
2.  Obtain a free yFiles evaluation package.
    
    To use yFiles, get a free evaluation package[here](https://my.yworks.com/signup?product=YFILES_HTML_EVAL).
    
3.  Create a designated area in CreateLlama's frontend application.
    
    The yFiles graph component only requires a container element where the graph should be visualized. For example in the CreateLlama frontend, create a new designated container element (see [page.tsx](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-graph-for-create-llama/blob/main/frontend/app/page.tsx)) that holds our element:
    
    ```
<div className="w-[70%] w-full ml-4 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-xl">
  <KnowledgeGraph />
</div>

```

    
4.  Create a yFiles GraphComponent.
    
    A yFiles GraphComponent can be easily integrated in any HTML5 supporting framework by providing a container element to the GraphComponent constructor. For example, in React, a useMemo in combination with a useLayoutEffect is a possible solution as demonstrated in [use-graph-component.ts](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-graph-for-create-llama/blob/main/frontend/app/components/graphcomponent/use-graph-component.ts):
    
    ```
// create the GraphComponent 
const graphComponent = useMemo(() => {
  // include the license
  License.value = yFilesLicense
  // initialize the GraphComponent
  const gc = new GraphComponent()
  // use out of the box interactivity
  gc.inputMode = new GraphViewerInputMode()
  return gc
}, [])
```

    
    ```
// append it in the DOM
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  const gcContainer = graphComponentContainer.current!
  graphComponent.div.style.width = '100%'
  graphComponent.div.style.height = '100%'
  gcContainer.appendChild(graphComponent.div)

  return () => {
    gcContainer.innerHTML = ''
  }
}, [graphComponentContainer, graphComponent])

```

    
5.  Provide structured node and edge data.
    
    In the Python backend, the knowledge graph provides access to node and edge lists that is all that is needed to create a graph visualization (see [getData.py](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-graph-for-create-llama/blob/main/backend/app/getData.py)):
    
    ```
def get_knowledge_graph_info(params=None):
  index = get_index()
  nodes = index.property_graph_store.graph.nodes
  edges = index.property_graph_store.graph.triplets
  return {'nodes': create_node_list(nodes), 'edges': create_edge_list(edges)}

```

    
6.  Request knowledge graph data in the frontend.
    
    The GraphComponent in the frontend requires structured node/edge data to create a graph. This can be requested from the backend:
    
    ```
const fetchKnowledgeGraph = async () => {        
  const response = await axios.get(`${backend}/api/knowledge_graph/knowledge-graph`);
  setKnowledgeGraph(response.data.graph_info);
}
```

    
    yFiles' GraphBuilder can be configured to the structure of the provided data and manages build and update of the graph, for details, see [use-graph-builder.ts](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-graph-for-create-llama/blob/main/frontend/app/components/graphcomponent/use-graph-builder.ts).
7.  Add more yFiles features as needed.
    
    yFiles' extensive [documentation](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/home/), [developer's guide](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/) and [source code demos](https://www.yfiles.com/demos) provide an easy way to add more sophisticated features as needed. Common features for a knowledge graph visualization are illustrated in [yfiles-graph-for-create-llama](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-graph-for-create-llama):
    
    *   Data-driven coloring of nodes and edges
    *   Showing more context information on selection or hover of a graph item
    *   Automatic circular arrangement of graph items
    *   Interactive exploring of the local neighborhood of nodes by double click
    
    For more details, see the source code of this [CreateLlama project](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-graph-for-create-llama/blob/main/frontend/app/components/graphcomponent/ReactGraphComponent.tsx) or the yFiles' [source code demos](https://www.yfiles.com/demos).
8.  Run the project.
    
    Run backend and frontend as described in the [CreateLlama](https://github.com/run-llama/create-llama) documentation.
