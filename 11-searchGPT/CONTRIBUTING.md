# I would like to make it better..

Thanks for your contribution!

### Determine what to do

There are so many possibilities to start with. For example

- Studies on API calls like Toolformer
- Studies on uncertainty in the search results. If the response is unsure or source didn't contain useful info, it shouldn't answer with confident.
- Studies in open-source model integration and not relies on API. To be better, even using RLHF model
- Studies on better generation of footnote. In word-level, or instrinsic model generated footnote.
- Prompt engineering
- Supports of markdown, code result, point form result, etc.
- Use it to generate data for training of another LLM model
- Make a better/robust UI
- ...

### Taking on Tasks

Please create a github issue on a problem that appeals to you.
If there are any issues/features you want to address, mention them in your comment along with a brief explanation of
how you'll resolve the issue. As soon as a project coordinator assigns you the problem, you can start working on it. (But you can still start first!)

### Submitting a Pull Request
(We are not familiar with Github process. This reference LAION-AI/Open-Assistant)

1. [Fork this project repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
   and clone it to your local machine. (Read more
   [About Forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks))
1. Before working on any changes, try to
   [sync the forked repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)
   to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository.
1. On a
   [new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)
   in your fork (aka a "feature branch" and not `master`) work on a small focused change that only touches on a few files.
1. Package up a small bit of work that solves part of the problem
   [into a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
   and
   [send it out for review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).
   [Here](https://github.com/michaelthwan/searchGPT/pull/42) is an example PR
   for this project to illustrate this flow.
1. If you're lucky, we can merge your change into `master` without any problems.
   If there are changes to files you're working on, resolve them by:
    1. First try to rebase as suggested
       [in these instructions](https://timwise.co.uk/2019/10/14/merge-vs-rebase/#should-you-rebase).
    1. If rebasing feels too painful, merge as suggested
       [in these instructions](https://timwise.co.uk/2019/10/14/merge-vs-rebase/#should-you-merge).
1. Once you've resolved conflicts (if any), finish the review and
   [squash and merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-commits)
   your PR (when squashing try to clean up or update the individual commit
   messages to be one sensible single one).
1. Merge in your change and move on to a new issue or the second step of your current issue.

Additionally, if someone is working on an issue that interests you, ask if they
need help on it or would like suggestions on how to approach the issue. If so,
share wildly. If they seem to have a good handle on it, let them work on their
solution until a challenge comes up.
