# Langchain Course Code
## Large Language Model Applications with Langchain, Langserve, and Llamaindex

### 📚 Introduction
This repository focuses on the applications of large language models, particularly using Langchain, Langserve, and Llamaindex for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications and Agentic applications. We will gradually build a knowledge system for RAG, covering concepts from basic to advanced levels.

### 🚀 Course Plan
This repo will continuously update course content, expected to continue until **the end of 2025**. Here is our course plan:

1. **Naive RAG**
2. **Advanced RAG**
3. **Modular RAG**

As the course progresses, you will gradually build layers of knowledge concepts and knowledge graphs, and learn how to apply technologies like LangGraph, Langserve, and GraphRAG.

### 📅 Important Dates
- **End of 2024 to early 2025**: The course plan and content will be continuously updated.

### 🌟 LangGraph New Content (2024/9/21)
