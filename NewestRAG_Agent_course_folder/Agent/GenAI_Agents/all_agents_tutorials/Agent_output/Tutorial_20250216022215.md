# LangChain and LangGraph Tutorial

## Introduction

LangChain and LangGraph are powerful tools for building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). LangChain provides a structured framework for chaining LLMs with other components, while LangGraph offers a visual interface for designing and managing these chains. This tutorial will introduce the core concepts of both tools and demonstrate their usage with practical Python examples.

## LangChain

LangChain simplifies the development of LLM-based applications by providing modular components like models, prompts, chains, and agents. It enables complex workflows by combining these components in a flexible manner.

### Key Concepts

* **LLMs:**  The core building blocks, providing language processing capabilities.
* **Prompts:** Instructions or contexts that guide the LLM's responses.
* **Chains:** Sequences of operations, including LLM calls and other computations.
* **Agents:**  Autonomous entities that can decide which actions to take based on the LLM's output.

### Example: Creating a Simple Chain

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

# Initialize an LLM (replace with your actual API key)
llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Define a prompt template
template = "What is the capital of {country}?"
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["country"])

# Create an LLM chain
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Run the chain
country = "France"
result = chain.run(country)
print(result)
```

## LangGraph

LangGraph is a visual tool for designing and managing LangChain workflows. It allows you to create complex chains by dragging and dropping components, making it easier to visualize and experiment with different configurations.

### Key Features

* **Visual Interface:** Drag-and-drop interface for building chains.
* **Component Library:** Access to a variety of pre-built components.
* **Chain Management:** Easily save, load, and share chain configurations.
* **Debugging:** Tools for inspecting intermediate steps and outputs.

### Example: Visualizing a Chain

While a direct code example for LangGraph within this environment isn't possible, the core idea is to represent the above LangChain example visually within the LangGraph interface. Each component (LLM, prompt, chain) would be a node in the graph, connected to illustrate the flow of data.  LangGraph then handles the execution of this visualized chain.
